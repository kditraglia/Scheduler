John DiTraglia has been practicing medicine since the mid 1950s.  He receieved his PhD from the prestigious universidad de MÃ©xico.  He is also a best selling author with his book about the effect of french fries when applied to rats.  He once fought a bear with only his bare hands, and a 12 gauge shotgun.  He also has a magic flying turtle which he summons on occasion when taking group photos with his office staff.  In his spare time he likes to tell sick children that they are in fact fine, and should sleep and drink plenty of fluids (if they were feeling particularly frisky, maybe add a motrin into the mix).  His favorite color is turquois, and he also enjoys long walks on the beach.  If you would like to schedule an appointment with this legendary gentleman, be sure to click the 'Schedule an Appointment' button.  If it doesn't work, it's probably because his lazy son decided to write a short story on the about page instead of adding the ability to schedule appointments, instead maybe just call 740-354-6605.
